 * represent the errors and defects of the magician that he himself has to annihilate.
 * Every wizard who makes it out alive will have gone through a transformative re-education and reconversion process that will
 * You will return to the real world as a good profit magician.
 *      Very well, you have been a bad magician, and you have been sentenced toâ€¦
